A 3D implementaion above <canvas> element of a simple and stupid raycasting engine.
  
What the project current has:

* Basic canvas API with scale support;
* Basic mapping tool to create new maps and render saved ones;
* Keyboard binding tool to provide easy key binding;
* Framerate controller;
* Basic player class controll;
* Basic "Engine" to put it all together;

The roadmap:

* Short term
** Tile collision detection
** Casting rays to render a basic 3D view
** Remove jquery from project
** Performance refactor
** Better log tool
** Framerate should control game status (play, pause)
* Long term
** Canvas API focused on performance and as an object oriented way;
** Separate Mapping render from mapping creation tool;
** Complete tool to create maps (insert sprites, type of tiles, scripted events, etc);
** Engine must support 3 perspectives: basic 3d, top view, side scroll;
** Multiplayer suport (client/server)
